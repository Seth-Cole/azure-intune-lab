# Azure-Intune-Lab
Created an Intune environment to monitor device compliance, enforce Windows configuration baselines, and deploy a managed list of applications to a Windows 11 VM in VMWare.

## Project Overview
- Intune environment was deployed using M365 developer license
- Tenant created during deployment of Intune environment (LearningInc931)
- VMWare workstation pro installed on local machine with a Windows 11 pro VM created
- Microsoft word used for initial documentation
- Total hours spent on this project
    - 2 hours for research and outline:
        - Researching Intune documentation for knowledge gaps
        - Deciding what project will include, logical flow of creating resources, method of documentation
        - Defining desired Outcomes
    - 3-4 hours for building VM, Configuring compliance Policies, Defining configuration baseline, and Testing Deployment
    - 1-2 hours for transcribing documentation into GitHub repo

## Design Decisions
1. **Security Groups** - Created logical grouping for users and devices for targeted deployment of compliance and configuration policies.
2. **Compliance Policy** - Created a compliance policy for Windows platforms to assess device security risks. If the following compliance standards aren't met, an automated email notification with remediation steps is sent:
    - Password Requirements - Improved password security and hygiene
    - Minimum OS version - Prevents the use of OS that is EOL and mitigates any vulnerabilities due to missing security patches
    - BitLocker disk encryption - Protects misplaced or stolen devices by encrypting and securing data
    - Secure Boot restrictions - Ensures that boot disk was not tampered with prior to device boot
3. **Configuration Profile** - Created a configuration baseline for Windows platform using a settings catalog, which enforces configurations including:
    - Disk Encryption with BitLocker
    - Password: history, complexity, length, and age
    - Account lockout after 3 failed attempts
    - Windows updates - download and install Windows updates automatically and restart as needed outside of specified time range.
4. **Managed Applications** - Deployed managed list of applications, enabling centralized app management.
